# Block Blast CAS Project

by: Daniel, Ishaan, Javier, Siddharth, Anshul

This goal of this of this project is to recreate a popular mobile game, Block Blast. To satisfy the requirement of adding global engagement, this game will include informational aspects that will replace the ads that appear in the game. The aim of this recreation is not for any type of monetary gain, but rather for learning and educational purposes. Part of the IB curriculum includes completing a CAS Project which requires collaboration between individuals completing one of the strands of CAS. Our project will complete the Creative strand and we intend to gather valuable experience from the skills we learn that involve this recreation.

At the current moment, our plan is to recreate this game using Pygame in the Python programming language. This may change, but this is our current plan. This means that this recreation will only be able to be played on computers, not mobile phones.
