i want to make a game with pygame where there is an 8x8 grid.
the user is given three blocks that they must drag into the grid and place in areas that are not already covered by blocks.
these three blocks should be located to the right of the grid and should not overlap other blocks and should not overlap the grid.
grid snapping should reference the user's mouse position relative to the block to ensure accurate placement.
a block ghost preview should appear where the block would land, snapping to the grid, and should not show in invalid positions.
if blocks are dragged to invalid positions, they should go back to their first spot.
when a row/column is completely full, the row is deleted.
rows above should not shift down.
the row should have a ripple delete animation when it is cleared.
after all three blocks have been placed, a new three blocks are provided.
these three blocks should be completely random from all possible blocks and orientations, but should not repeat the same type of block.
the user loses when they are unable to place any of the blocks in their hand.

possible blocks:
1x3
1x4
1x5
2x2
2x3
3x3
Z shape (2x3)
L shape (2x3)
L shape (3x3)
T shape (2x3)
Each block type has 4 fixed possible orientations that are randomly selected when the block is generated and they cannot be rotated.
blocks are random colors from a set of bright color options.

scoring:
your score is also increased by the (# of rows cleared)^2 * multiplier * 10 + (# of cells in placed block)

you keep your multiplier streak if you clear a row within three moves after your last row cleared.
the streak increases per number of rows cleared.
